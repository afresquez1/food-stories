## Analysis: Re Chile, Masa, Pork, and Beef?

Analysis of Interview: 

After listening to my Aunts story about her homemade Tamales, I have acknowledged the generational gap and how much things have changed over 40+ years. A woman from my Aunts generation takes pride in being a home maker and affirms her identity through how well she takes care of her family. Although through economical struggles they adapted and took on jobs while continuing to take care of their homes, it was more rare for women to be in the work force 40 years ago. Today, women are a major part of the work force and household duties should be shared by both working partners since both are contributing financially. In the past it would be very rare if you found a man in the kitchen cooking tamales. These gender roles are no longer as relevant in today's society.Some households may even have the dad/husband as the primary stay at home parent while the mom/wife goes to work and is the breadwinner. 

Having a stay at home parent can create a sense of comfort for all who are in the household  because they have the time to produce better meals because they have more time to create them, they also have a calmer demeanor because they are not trying to do two full time jobs (their career and a homemaker), and they can all around focus on the needs of their families 100%. In today's economy and society in general, I feel that living off one income is not possible for many families, and it is a luxury that many have to go without. For my Aunt, she loved having her family around her and providing a home cooked meal for them. She makes her tamales not only for Christmas day, but she also makes dozens that she gives to her family as Christmas presents because so many of us love her tamales.

Tamales are one of the oldest dishes that are still recreated, they trace all the way back to the Aztecs. Tamales are a part of New Mexican culture because of our red chile, but they have come from Mesoamerica where they were authentic to those people at that time. Our Red Chile beef tamales are authentic to my family right now, because they are passed down generationally through tradition. I see tamales as both expressive and historically authentic. Each of these aspects of authenticity matter because each of these tamales creations were made in a specific place, at a specific time, for a specific community through their own methods creating an authentic food experience.

New Mexico is a special state in terms of food and culture. We have blended Mexican food, Native American food, and Anglo American food to create a food genre of our own. We have cultivated our own identity and created original associations of flavors with our home state. My Aunt has taken her recipe and made it authentic to herself by replacing the traditional pork as the protein in the tamales and instead used  beef. This doesn't make her tamales any less authentic, but rather more expressive of her own personal expression.
